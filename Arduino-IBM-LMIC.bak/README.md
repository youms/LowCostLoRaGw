Arduino example sketches
========================

This folder contains sketches for Arduino (and compatible) boards. The example sketches, in increasing level of complexity, will show how simple, yet effective, low-cost LoRa IoT device can be programmed. For instance, they show how LoRa radio modules are configured and how a device can send sensed data to a gateway. They actually serve as template for future developments. On the Uno, Pro Mini, Mini, Nano and Teensy the minimum connection mapping is as follows:

```
       Arduino      Radio module
         GND----------GND   (ground in)
         3V3----------3.3V  (3.3V in)
  SS pin D10----------NSS   (CS chip select in)
 SCK pin D13----------SCK   (SPI clock in)
MOSI pin D11----------MOSI  (SPI Data in)
MISO pin D12----------MISO  (SPI Data out)
          D4----------RST   (Reset)
```

On the MEGA, the SPI pin are as follows: 50 (MISO), 51 (MOSI), 52 (SCK). Starting from November 3rd, 2017, the CS pin is always pin number 10 on Arduino and Teensy boards. You can have a look at the [Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-step-by-step](https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-outdoor-step-by-step.pdf) tutorial in the tutorial repository (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials).

All the examples use by default the so-called LoRa mode 1 (SF12BW125, CR4/5) at 865.2 Mhz (`CH_10_868`) to work with the default gateway configuration.

New (use SX12XX library from Stuart Robinson, modified for our framework)
---

It is highly recommended to use the new version of the examples as the old versions are not maintained any more.

**`Arduino_LoRa_SX12XX_Demo_Sensor`** is the new version of **`Arduino_LoRa_Demo_Sensor`** (see below) using the SX12XX library from Stuart Robinson to support the SX12XX LoRa chips: SX1261,SX1262,SX1268,SX1272,SX1276,SX1277,SX1278,SX1279,SX1280,SX1281.

**`Arduino_LoRa_SX12XX_Simple_temp`** is the new version of **`Arduino_LoRa_Simple_temp`** (see below) using the SX12XX library from Stuart Robinson to support the SX12XX LoRa chips: SX1261,SX1262,SX1268,SX1272,SX1276,SX1277,SX1278,SX1279,SX1280,SX1281. 

**`Arduino_LoRa_SX12XX_temp`** is the new version of **`Arduino_LoRa_temp`** (see below) using the SX12XX library from Stuart Robinson to support the SX12XX LoRa chips: SX1261,SX1262,SX1268,SX1272,SX1276,SX1277,SX1278,SX1279,SX1280,SX1281.

These 3 examples can be used as templates to adapt all the legacy examples to the SX12XX library.

**`Arduino_LoRa_SX12XX_Generic_DHT`** is the new version of **`Arduino_LoRa_Generic_DHT`** (see below) using the SX12XX library from Stuart Robinson to support the SX12XX LoRa chips: SX1261,SX1262,SX1268,SX1272,SX1276,SX1277,SX1278,SX1279,SX1280,SX1281.

**`Arduino_LoRa_SX12XX_Generic_Simple_MultiSensors`** is the new version of **`Arduino_LoRa_Generic_Simple_MultiSensors`** (see below) using the SX12XX library from Stuart Robinson to support the SX12XX LoRa chips: SX1261,SX1262,SX1268,SX1272,SX1276,SX1277,SX1278,SX1279,SX1280,SX1281.

**`Arduino_LoRa_SX12XX_Ping_Pong_LCD`** is the new version of **`Arduino_LoRa_Ping_Pong_LCD`** (see below) using the SX12XX library from Stuart Robinson to support the SX12XX LoRa chips: SX1261,SX1262,SX1268,SX1272,SX1276,SX1277,SX1278,SX1279,SX1280,SX1281.

**`Arduino_LoRa_SX12XX_InteractiveDevice`** is the new version of **`Arduino_LoRa_InteractiveDevice`** (see below) using the SX12XX library from Stuart Robinson to support the SX12XX LoRa chips: SX1261,SX1262,SX1268,SX1272,SX1276,SX1277,SX1278,SX1279,SX1280,SX1281.

**`Arduino_LoRa_SX12XX_Simple_gateway`** is a very simple Arduino-based gateway using the SX12XX library from Stuart Robinson to support the SX12XX LoRa chips: SX1261,SX1262,SX1268,SX1272,SX1276,SX1277,SX1278,SX1279,SX1280,SX1281. In addition, the code shows how the same code can be compiled and run on Arduino and RaspberryPI. `Arduino_LoRa_SX12XX_Simple_gateway.ino` is exactly the same code than `SX12XX_simple_lora_gateway.cpp` for the RaspberryPI, see https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/tree/master/gw_full_latest.

**`Arduino_LoRa_SX1280_ranging_master`** is based on the SX128XLT ranging master example from the SX12XX library. We added the possibility to indicate dynamically the real distance for dynamic calibration.

**`Arduino_LoRa_SX1280_ranging_slave`** is based on the SX128XLT ranging slave example from the SX12XX library. We added the possibility to also compile on the Raspberry in order to use the gateway as the slave for distance computation at the end-device. For the Raspberry, the example is called `SX1280_ranging_slave.cpp`. If you want to compile on the Raspberry, type `make SX1280_ranging_slave` or  `make SX1280_ranging_slave_pi2` or `make SX1280_ranging_slave_pi4`, then `sudo ./ranging_slave`. Default LoRa settings are defined in `SX1280_ranging_slave.h`. On a Raspberry, you can add arguments to dynamically change bw, sf and frequency: `sudo ./ranging_slave --bw 400 --sf 8 --freq 2403.0`. 

Legacy (use SX1272/76 library initially from Libelium, modified for our framework)
------

**`Arduino_LoRa_Demo_Sensor`** is a very simple demo sketch for training purpose. The main program, i.e. `Arduino_LoRa_Demo_Sensor` can be left unchanged by the students. They just have to add/modify code in `my_demo_sensor_code.h` and `my_demo_sensor_code.cpp` to adapt the code for a given physical sensor. The provided example reads from either an LM35DZ or a TMP36 analog temperature sensor. The sensor is connected on pin A0 and is powered with digital pin 9.

**`Arduino_LoRa_Simple_temp`** uses the same simple structure than `Arduino_LoRa_Demo_Sensor` where `my_temp_sensor_code.cpp` contains the code to read values from the physical sensor (which is still either an LM35DZ or a TMP36 analog temperature sensor). Additionally, this example illustrates how to implement periodic sensing with low-power mode to run on battery for years.  The sensor is connected on pin A0 and is powered with digital pin 9.

**`Arduino_LoRa_Simple_DHT`** shows how a more elaborated digital sensor such as the DHT22 (also known as AM2302) can be used. Code for DHT sensor is provided by the DHT library by Adafruit. This example therefore shows how you can use libraries provided by third-parties which is most likely the approach that you will use if you need to support a new physical sensor. Note that the DHT code can also be used for the AM2305 sensor. One advantage of the AM2305 is that it usually comes in an outdoor casing which make it suitable for outdoor and real-world deployment scenarios. Note that as it is a very simple example, only one physical measure is provided. In the example, it is the temperature even if the DHT22 sensor can provide both temperature and humidity. The sensor is connected on pin A0 and is powered with digital pin 9.

**`Arduino_LoRa_temp`** ends the simple temperature example serie. This final version illustrates more complex configurations: with AES encryption only (to do so, uncomment `#define WITH_AES`) or with **native LoRaWAN mode** (to do so, uncomment `#define LORAWAN`). It can also open a receive window after every transmission to wait for downlink message coming from the gateway (to do so, uncomment `#define WTH_RCVW`). In LoRaWAN mode, the downlink messages is generated by the Network Server and relayed by the gateway. RX1 (1s) and RX2 (RX1+1s) are handled. `Arduino_LoRa_temp` can be used to provide a limited support of LoRaWAN specification. Refer to section `LoRaWAN example and support` for more information. The template additionally shows how an '/@L2#' downlink command can be parsed to toggle a LED connected to digital pin 2. The example also implements a more accurate low-power timing. It can serve as a template for a more complex LoRa IoT device with actuation capability on downlink packets from the gateway. In the example the simple analog temperature sensor (LM35DZ or TMP36) should be connected on pin A0 and is powered with digital pin 9. 

**`Arduino_GPS_Parser_GGA`** is a very simple GPS example used to introduce the usage of GPS sensor modules. GPS modules are very popular sensors as geolocalization capabilities are quite attractive in IoT applications. Besides, these modules are becoming less and less expansive as a GPS module can be bought for about 5â‚¬ now (for instance the well-known UBlox 6M/7M/M8N modules). The program constantly reads data from the GPS serial (`gps_serial`) and will try to decode GPGGA messages. The GPS is connected using software serial thus enabling Serial Monitor debugging on Ardui Pro Mini (that has only one serial port which is used for Serial Monitor as well as for sketch upload). This example can served as a basis for a tracking device that parses in a very light-weight manner the GPGGA NMEA message. Once a fix is obtained, the GPGGA message will provide localization data and the program will convert the latitude and longitude into decimal degree that can directly be copied/pasted into GoogleMap for instance.

**`Arduino_LoRa_Simple_GPS`** is a more elaborated GPS system that we use to build a localization system for cattle collars. The device will periodically send a beacon message with a sequence number and the GPS coordinates in the following format `\!BC/0/LAT/43.31408/LGT/-0.36362/FXT/4172`.  Look at this [dedicated tutorial](https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-Collar.pdf) to build such a system where a MOFSET transistor is controlled by pin 8 in order to power up or shutdown the GPS module. In the tutorial, the GPS device can use an open source PCB board designed by Fabien Ferrero from LEAT laboratory, University of Nice, France, to easily integrate an Arduino Pro Mini and an RFM95W radio module. The PCB has an integrated antenna to avoid external fragile part. The PCB Gerber layout file can be obtained from [https://github.com/FabienFerrero/UCA_Board](https://github.com/FabienFerrero/UCA_Board). Here is a [1-click order link](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/W48634ASK5_UCA_reverse.html) on PCBWAY.com. The latest PCB version with more holes for more connectivity options can be ordered from [here](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/UCA_Board.html).

On the gateway side, this example also shows how a dedicated "cloud" task, `CloudGpsFile.py`, is implemented and enabled in `clouds.json` to process GPS messages from remote GPS devices and to compute their distance to the gateway. More details are provided in this [dedicated tutorial](https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-Collar.pdf).

**`Arduino_LoRa_Generic_DHT`** shows a more "generic" approach to handle physical sensors. All physical sensors must be derived from a base `Sensor` class (defined in `Sensor.cpp` and `Sensor.h`) and should provide a `get_value()` and `get_nomenclature()` function. Some predefined physical sensors are already defined, but we are demonstrating only the DHT22 in this example:

- very simple LM35DZ analog temperature sensor
- very simple TMP36 analog temperature sensor
- digital DHT22 (AM2302) temperature and humidity sensor (work also with the AM2305)
- digital SHT1x and SHT2x temperature and humidity sensor from Sensirion
- digital DS18B20 temperature sensor
- ultra-sonic HC-SR04 distance sensor
- Davies Leaf Wetness sensor
- general raw analog sensor

All the periodic task loop with duty-cycle low-power management is already there as in previous examples. In this `Arduino_LoRa_Generic_DHT` example, we show how the DHT22 sensor is handled by declaring 2 logical sensors: one for the temperature and one for the humidity. Again, the DHT code is the one from Adafruit and it is wrapped in our own generic sensor library.

To use the template, you just have to define the number of logical sensors you want to consider:

	// SENSORS DEFINITION 
	//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	// CHANGE HERE THE NUMBER OF SENSORS, SOME CAN BE NOT CONNECTED
	const int number_of_sensors = 2;
	//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	
And add the logical sensors. For each physical sensor, you have to indicate a nomemclature string, whether it is analog or not, whether it is connected to your board or not, whether its power pin is regulated by low-power management or not, the read pin, the power pin and an optional trigger pin. Here, the DHT22 is connected on pin A0 and is powered with digital pin 9.

	//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	// ADD YOUR SENSORS HERE   
	// Sensor(nomenclature, is_analog, is_connected, is_low_power, pin_read, pin_power, pin_trigger=-1)
	sensor_ptrs[0] = new DHT22_Temperature("TC", IS_NOT_ANALOG, IS_CONNECTED, low_power_status, A0, 9);
	sensor_ptrs[1] = new DHT22_Humidity("HU", IS_NOT_ANALOG, IS_CONNECTED, low_power_status, A0, 9);	

Then the control loop that is periodically executed in the template is as follows:

	char final_str[80] = "\\!";
	char aux[6] = "";
	
	for (int i=0; i<number_of_sensors; i++) {
	
	    if (sensor_ptrs[i]->get_is_connected() || sensor_ptrs[i]->has_fake_data()) {
	      
	        ftoa(aux, sensor_ptrs[i]->get_value(), 2);
	    
	        if (i==0) {
	            sprintf(final_str, "%s%s/%s", final_str, sensor_ptrs[i]->get_nomenclature(), aux);
	        } 
	        else {
	            sprintf(final_str, "%s/%s/%s", final_str, sensor_ptrs[i]->get_nomenclature(), aux);
	        }
	    }
	}
      
With the DHT example, the transmitted data string can be as follows:

	\!TC/27.79/HU/56.50  

You can look at the provided examples to see how you can write a specific sensor class for a specific/new physical sensor. The previous simple temperature example `Arduino_LoRa_Simple_temp` can be obtained from the generic example by simply using a single sensor declaration with the LM35 class (i.e. as `sensor_ptrs[0]`).	

**`Arduino_LoRa_Generic_Simple_MultiSensors`** is an extension of the previous example to handle 7 logical sensors.

	// SENSORS DEFINITION 
	//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	// CHANGE HERE THE NUMBER OF SENSORS, SOME CAN BE NOT CONNECTED
	const int number_of_sensors = 7;
	//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

With the following sensors:

	//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	// ADD YOUR SENSORS HERE   
	// Sensor(nomenclature, is_analog, is_connected, is_low_power, pin_read, pin_power, pin_trigger=-1)
	sensor_ptrs[0] = new LM35("LM35", IS_ANALOG, IS_CONNECTED, low_power_status, (uint8_t) A0, (uint8_t) 9 /*no pin trigger*/);
	sensor_ptrs[1] = new TMP36("TMP36", IS_ANALOG, IS_CONNECTED, low_power_status, (uint8_t) A1, (uint8_t) 8 /*no pin trigger*/);  
	sensor_ptrs[2] = new DHT22_Temperature("TC1", IS_NOT_ANALOG, IS_CONNECTED, low_power_status, (uint8_t) A2, (uint8_t) 7 /*no pin trigger*/);
	sensor_ptrs[3] = new DHT22_Humidity("HU1", IS_NOT_ANALOG, IS_CONNECTED, low_power_status, (uint8_t) A2, (uint8_t) 7 /*no pin trigger*/);
	//for SHT, pin_trigger will be the clock pin
	sensor_ptrs[4] = new SHT_Temperature("TC2", IS_NOT_ANALOG, IS_CONNECTED, low_power_status, (uint8_t) 2, (uint8_t) 6, (uint8_t) 5);
	sensor_ptrs[5] = new SHT_Humidity("HU2", IS_NOT_ANALOG, IS_CONNECTED, low_power_status, (uint8_t) 2, (uint8_t) 6, (uint8_t) 5);
	sensor_ptrs[6] = new DS18B20("DS", IS_NOT_ANALOG, IS_CONNECTED, low_power_status, (uint8_t) 3, (uint8_t) 4 /*no pin trigger*/);
	
	// for non connected sensors, indicate whether you want some fake data, for test purposes for instance
	//sensor_ptrs[3]->set_fake_data(true);
	//sensor_ptrs[4]->set_fake_data(true); 
	
	//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  	
	
Compared to the previous example, you can see how sensors that are not connected can provide emulated data for test purposes. With the declared sensors, the transmitted data string can be as follows:

	\!LM35/27.71/TMP36/27.2/TC1/27.79/HU1/56.50/TC2/28.63/HU2/50.49/DS/27.93

This generic multi-sensors example drives 5 types of temperature and humidity sensors (LM35DZ, TMP36, DHT22, SHT10, DS18B20) on the same node. You can see our [ThingSpeak channel here](https://thingspeak.com/channels/66583) that shows Sensor 3 data.

**`Arduino_LoRa_Ping_Pong`** shows a simple ping-pong communication between a LoRa device and a gateway by requesting an acknowlegment for data messages sent to the gateway. This example can serve as a simple range test as the device displays back the SNR of the received packet on the gateway.

**`Arduino_LoRa_Ping_Pong_LCD`** is an extended version that uses an OLED display to show in real-time the results of the range test. The pictures below show our simple range tester built from an Heltec ESP32 WiFi LoRa with OLED display. Plenty of information on this nice board are available from https://robotzero.one/heltec-wifi-lora-32/ and https://github.com/darthm0e/esp32-101 to name a few. 

![](https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/blob/master/images/pingpong.png)

We also use a regular Arduino Pro Mini or Arduino Nano with an I2C 0.96inch OLED display (such as [this one]( https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1pcs-0-96-blue-0-96-inch-OLED-module-New-128X64-OLED-LCD-LED-Display-Module/32643950109.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.LbMu7r)). You can connect SDA and SCL to pin A4 and A5 respectively. Of course, connect your LoRa module as usual. For range test prior to deploying the sensor nodes, it is recommended to build the Ping-Pong tester with the case that you will use for your final end-devices because the impact of the case on transmission quality is important (see [this antenna presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhFy4-kForA&feature=youtu.be) from our colleague Fabien Ferrero). On the left part you can see an Arduino Nano using the Modtronix inAir9 radio module with the external antenna. On the right part, it is an Arduino Pro Mini with the integrated antenna provided by a simple PCB (see the `Arduino_LoRa_GPS` description).

![](https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/blob/master/images/pingpong_1.jpg)

**`Arduino_LoRa_InteractiveDevice`** is a tool that turns an Arduino board to an interactive device where a user can interactively enter data to be sent to a receiver/gateway using the Arduino Serial Monitor tool. Pure LoRa and LoRaWAN packet can be interactively sent and there are many parameters that can dynamically be configured: frequency, BW, SF, sync word, encryption, inter-packet time, Carrier Sense (Listen-Before-Talk),... We use this sketch extensively for test and debug purposes as it can be compiled/or configured to serve for instance as a periodic sender or perform continuous CAD.

**`Arduino_LoRa_Gateway`** is now mainly used to build a simple Arduino-based gateway (for test purposes for instance). WARNING: the non-Arduino code is still here but it is not maintained anymore. Starting from Jan, 20th, 2020, the `lora_gateway.cpp` for RaspberryPI-based gateway is developed independently (https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/tree/master/gw_full_latest). When using the Arduino Serial Monitor tool, commands can be interactively entered to dynamically configure the simple gateway: frequency, SF, raw mode, hex output,... We extensively use this sketch, along with `Arduino_LoRa_InteractiveDevice` for test and debug purposes. In the image below, we have the device on the left running `Arduino_LoRa_InteractiveDevice` in continuous CAD mode in order to test the LoRa Channel Activity Detection mechanism. The device on the right side runs `Arduino_LoRa_Gateway` to act as a simple gateway, receiving messages. We then have another device (not shown in the image) running `Arduino_LoRa_InteractiveDevice` configured to send a 220-byte packet every 2s. The packet from the transmitting device will be received by the gateway device and, at the same time, CAD detection is tested in real-time.

![](https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/blob/master/images/cad-test.jpg)

**`Arduino_LoRa_ucamII`** is the image IoT sensor device for multimedia sensing. Read [this specific page](http://cpham.perso.univ-pau.fr/WSN-MODEL/tool-html/imagesensor.html) and this [specific tutorial](https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-ImageIoT-step-by-step.pdf) for more informations on how to build and run the image sensor.

What Arduino boards are supported?
==================================

One main issue for a eligible board is to have a 3.3v pin to power the radio module. Some boards do not have such pin (Arduino Mini or Arduino Pro Mini in the 5V version for instance) and therefore although the software can be compiled and uploaded, connecting the radio module needs an additional voltage regulator that we want to avoid. Therefore, we exclusively use boards with built-in 3.3v pin. The following boards have been tested:

**Small form factor**

- Arduino Pro Mini (8MHz/3.3V version is better for power consumption), Arduino Nano (ATmega328 16MHz/5V but 3.3v pin), Arduino Micro (ATmega32u4 16MHz/5V but 3.3v pin)
- Probably all boards based on ATmega328P such IoT-MCU LoRa Radio Node for instance
- Adafruit Feather32u4 and FeatherM0
- Ideetron Nexus (which is an ATmega328P at 3.3v, select as Arduino Mini in IDE)  
- Teensy LC/31/32/35/36
- Expressif ESP8266 (only the **`Arduino_LoRa_Simple_temp`** has been modified to support the ESP8266)
- Expressif ESP32 (tested but support is not integrated into library, so you need to change the CS pin according to your board model)

**Uno/MEGA form factor**

- Arduino Uno, MEGA2560, Due
- Arduino Zero, M0 (require IDE 1.7.x from http://www.arduino.org)

For low-power and IoT integration desin, it is better to use either Arduino Pro Mini 8MHz/3.3v or the TeensyLC/31/32. On the Pro Mini, AES encryption can be used but then you may run out of RAM memory if you need additional library for specific physical sensors. The TeensyLC/31/32 has much more RAM memory, allowing much bigger project with AES encryption and many physical sensors. If you want to build an interactive device, it is better to use a MEGA2560 or Due or TeensyLC/31/32 because of memory limitation that may cause the lower memory boards to be unstable.

Note that there might be current limitation issues on some boards. The radio module can draw more than 50mA when transmitting (depending on the programmed transmission power) so the current limit of most microcontroller's analog/digital pins is reached. See for instance http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/ArduinoPinCurrentLimitations. It is better to connect the radio module VCC to a dedicated 3.3v pin that usually has higher current limit. However, it may be still not enough on some boards if you use PA_BOOST at 20dBm for your radio module. So be careful. For the MEGA, Due, and Teensy, they have a 3.3v pin with higher current limit so there should not be current issues with these boards.

What about other boards?
------------------------

Other boards may be supported as well with only very few modifications. However, for all the other boards, low-power features may need to use specific libraries depending on the microcontroller. If you have compilation issues, try to compile with low-power and EEPROM disabled:

	//#define LOW_POWER
	//#define WITH_EEPROM

Configuring the device
======================

Frequency
---------

There are a number of configuration options that can be either enabled or disabled by respectively uncommenting or commenting some definition. The first block that you can configure is for the radio regulation and the frequency band. By default, ETSI-based regulations for Short Range Devices (SRD) is used in the 868MHz frequency band. 

	///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	// please uncomment only 1 choice
	//
	#define ETSI_EUROPE_REGULATION
	//#define FCC_US_REGULATION
	//#define SENEGAL_REGULATION

	///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	// please uncomment only 1 choice
	#define BAND868
	//#define BAND900
	//#define BAND433
	///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	
Here is a reminder of the pre-defined radio frequency channels in the library:

If you select `ETSI_EUROPE_REGULATION` then available channels are channels `CH_10_868` to `CH_18_868` and the default channel will be `CH_10_868`. If you select `SENEGAL_REGULATION` then available channels are channels `CH_04_868` to `CH_09_868` and the default channel will be `CH_04_868`. There might also be some regulation concerning the maximum transmit power. It is 14dBm (25mW) for ETSI and 10dBm (10mW) in Senegal for instance, as shown below. You can modify these sections according to your needs. 

	#ifdef ETSI_EUROPE_REGULATION
	#define MAX_DBM 14
	#elif defined SENEGAL_REGULATION
	#define MAX_DBM 10
	#endif
	
	#ifdef BAND868
	#ifdef SENEGAL_REGULATION
	const uint32_t DEFAULT_CHANNEL=CH_04_868;
	#else
	const uint32_t DEFAULT_CHANNEL=CH_10_868;
	#endif
	#elif defined BAND900
	const uint32_t DEFAULT_CHANNEL=CH_05_900;
	#elif defined BAND433
	const uint32_t DEFAULT_CHANNEL=CH_00_433;
	#endif
	
Although 900MHz band is supported (mostly for the US ISM band) by using `CH_05_900` as default channel, the library does not implement the frequency hopping mechanism nor the limited dwell time (e.g. 400ms per transmission). It is up to the programmer to ensure, by using appropriate LoRa settings and message size, that the 400ms limit is satisfied. Therefore, for the moment, `FCC_US_REGULATION` is not implemented.

Finally, if you need to set up a particular frequency that may be not listed in the default frequency list, just modify the `MY_FREQUENCY` definition as shown below:

	//uncomment to use a customized frequency. TTN plan includes 868.1/868.3/868.5/867.1/867.3/867.5/867.7/867.9 for LoRa
	#define MY_FREQUENCY 868.1

Adapting frequency for your country
-----------------------------------

We can have a better view on the available license-free frequency bands by looking at the current specification of LoRaWAN which defines the set of default frequency channels for EU 863-870MHz ISM Band & EU 433MHz ISM Band, US 902-928MHz ISM Band, China 779-787MHz ISM Band & China 470-510MHz Band, Australia 915-928MHz ISM Band, South Korea 920-923MHz ISM Band and AS923 ISM Band channel frequencies. The last AS923 ISM Band applies to regions where the frequencies [923...923.5MHz] are comprised in the ISM band, which is the case for the following countries:

- Brunei [923-925 MHz]
- Cambodia [923-925 MHz]
- Hong Kong [920-925 MHz]
- Indonesia [923-925 MHz]
- Japan [920-928 MHz]
- Laos [923-925 MHz]
- Malaysia [919-923 MHz]
- New Zealand [915-928 MHz]
- Philippines [918-920 MHz]
- Singapore [920-925 MHz]
- Taiwan [922-928 MHz]
- Thailand [920-925 MHz]
- Vietnam [920-925 MHz]

You can easily redefine the default frequency for your country. For instance, if we take the case of Vietnam, you can select the 900MHz band by uncommenting BAND900:

	///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	// please uncomment only 1 choice
	//#define BAND868
	#define BAND900
	//#define BAND433
	///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	
and change the default channel to CH_08_900=920.36MHz as follows:

	#ifdef BAND868
	#ifdef SENEGAL_REGULATION
	const uint32_t DEFAULT_CHANNEL=CH_04_868;
	#else
	const uint32_t DEFAULT_CHANNEL=CH_10_868;
	#endif
	#elif defined BAND900
	const uint32_t DEFAULT_CHANNEL=CH_08_900; // <------- here
	#elif defined BAND433
	const uint32_t DEFAULT_CHANNEL=CH_00_433;
	#endif

If you want, you can also change for the gateway side in lora_gateway.cpp. First the band:

	// IMPORTANT
	///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	// please uncomment only 1 choice
	//#define BAND868
	#define BAND900
	//#define BAND433
	///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

then the default channel declaration:

	#ifdef BAND868
	#define MAX_NB_CHANNEL 15
	#define STARTING_CHANNEL 4
	#define ENDING_CHANNEL 18
	#ifdef SENEGAL_REGULATION
	uint8_t loraChannelIndex=0;
	#else
	uint8_t loraChannelIndex=6;
	#endif
	uint32_t loraChannelArray[MAX_NB_CHANNEL]={CH_04_868,CH_05_868,CH_06_868,CH_07_868,CH_08_868,CH_09_868,
												CH_10_868,CH_11_868,CH_12_868,CH_13_868,CH_14_868,CH_15_868,CH_16_868,CH_17_868,CH_18_868};

	#elif defined BAND900 
	#define MAX_NB_CHANNEL 13
	#define STARTING_CHANNEL 0
	#define ENDING_CHANNEL 12
	uint8_t loraChannelIndex=8; // <------- here
	uint32_t loraChannelArray[MAX_NB_CHANNEL]={CH_00_900,CH_01_900,CH_02_900,CH_03_900,CH_04_900,CH_05_900,CH_06_900,CH_07_900,CH_08_900,
												CH_09_900,CH_10_900,CH_11_900,CH_12_900};
	#elif defined BAND433
	#define MAX_NB_CHANNEL 4
	#define STARTING_CHANNEL 0
	#define ENDING_CHANNEL 3
	uint8_t loraChannelIndex=0;
	uint32_t loraChannelArray[MAX_NB_CHANNEL]={CH_00_433,CH_01_433,CH_02_433,CH_03_433};                                              
	#endif

However, it is **highly** advised to rather change the frequency setting at the gateway by editing the `gateway_conf.json` file:

	"radio_conf" : {
		"mode" : 1,
		"bw" : 500,
		"cr" : 5,
		"sf" : 12,
		"ch" : -1,
		"freq" : 920.36
	},	

PA_BOOST
--------

Depending on your radio module, you have to indicate whether PA_BOOST should be used or not. Uncomment if your radio is an HopeRF RFM92W, HopeRF RFM95W, Modtronix inAir9B, NiceRF1276 or if you known from the circuit diagram that output use the PA_BOOST line instead of the RFO line. Many boards uses the RFM95W (Adafruit LoRa Feather boards, Dragino LoRa shield/hat, Loranga board for instance). In this case, they behaves like an RFM95W so they need PA_BOOST. There is a nice discussion with tests comparing popular LoRa modules (including RFM95W and NiceRF) from [RocketScream](https://www.rocketscream.com/blog/2017/08/21/the-sx1276-modules-shootout-hoperfs-rfm95w-vs-nicerfs-lora1276-c1-vs-hpdteks-hpd13/).
	
	///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	//
	// uncomment if your radio is an HopeRF RFM92W, HopeRF RFM95W, Modtronix inAir9B, NiceRF1276
	// or you known from the circuit diagram that output use the PABOOST line instead of the RFO line
	//#define PABOOST
	/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 	

LoRa mode
---------

The next usefull configuration block defines the LoRa mode and the node address. If you deploy several sensor nodes then node address should be different from one sensor to another. For the moment, the address is between 2 and 255 included. 0 is for broadcast and 1 for the gateway.
	
	///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	// CHANGE HERE THE LORA MODE, NODE ADDRESS 
	#define LORAMODE  1
	#define node_addr 10
	//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	
Here is a reminder of the pre-defined LoRa modes as defined by the library.

| mode | BW | SF |
|------|----|----|
| 1    | 125| 12 |
| 2    | 250| 12 |
| 3    | 125| 10 |
| 4    | 500| 12 |
| 5    | 250| 10 |
| 6    | 500| 11 |
| 7    | 250|  9 |
| 8    | 500|  9 |
| 9    | 500|  8 |
| 10   | 500|  7 |	

Low-power
---------

Low-power management is handled by various low-power libraries. For Arduino boards, it is the `LowPower` library from Rocket Scream. For TeensyLC/31/32, it is the `Snooze` library. As indicated previously, if you use another board, you may need to use a specific low-power library, or disable low-power management. By default in the example, the device will wake up every 10 minutes. You can changed it to another value, expressed in minutes. If low power is not used, the duty-cycle behavior will still be implemented but with the `delay()` function which is not energy-efficient.

	#define LOW_POWER
	#define LOW_POWER_HIBERNATE

	///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	// CHANGE HERE THE TIME IN MINUTES BETWEEN 2 READING & TRANSMISSION
	unsigned int idlePeriodInMin = 10;
	///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////	
	
	
Using EEPROM
------------	

Most of Arduino boards's microcontroller do have built-in EEPROM, except for the Arduino Due and Zero. When EEPROM is available, then all the examples store the last sequence number so that a reset or a reboot will keep the correct sequence number. You can disable this feature by commenting the EEPROM define statement:

	#define WITH_EEPROM

Also, when your micro controller does not have built-in EEPROM, you should disable this feature to avoid compilation errors.

AES encryption
--------------

AES encryption can be enabled in `Arduino_LoRa_temp` and `Arduino_LoRa_Generic_DHT` with the following define statement:
	
	#define WITH_AES

Please refer to the [README-aes_lorawan](https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/blob/master/gw_full_latest/README-aes_lorawan.md) file.

Receive window
--------------

A receive window can be enabled in `Arduino_LoRa_temp` with the following define statement:
	
	#define WITH_RCVW
	
A receive window is opened after every transmission to wait for downlink message coming from the gateway. If LoRaWAN mode is activated (see below) then downlink messages from Network Server can be received using RX1 or RX2. The template shows for instance how an '/@L2#' downlink command can be parsed to toggle a LED connected to digital pin 2 or how an '/@A2#' command can be parsed to set the node's address to '2' (non-LoRaWAN mode only).	Note that the node's address can be saved in EEPROM so that a reset of the board will keep the new address. To do so, you have to comment the line:

	//#define FORCE_DEFAULT_VALUE
	
For more information on dynamic configuration of end-device, please read carefully the information in the `Arduino_LoRa_temp` template.	
	
For more information on how to perform downlink transmission from the gateway, please refer to the following [README](https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/blob/master/gw_full_latest/README-downlink.md).

LoRaWAN example and support
---------------------------

`Arduino_LoRa_LMIC_ABP_BASIC` is the basic LoRaWAN ABP (Activation By Personalization) example from Thomas Telkamp and Matthijs Kooijman using the LMIC port for Arduino. It sends "Hello from LMIC" using DR_SF12 (i.e. BW125SF12). In order to use `Arduino_LoRa_LMIC_ABP_BASIC`, you need to create a device for instance on TTN to get the device short address (32 bits) and, if you want, both NwkSKey and AppSKey. These information have to be filled in the example code. A nice tutorial can be found on [https://medium.com/kkbankol-events/tutorial-build-a-open-source-smart-city-based-on-lora-7ca76b9a098](https://medium.com/kkbankol-events/tutorial-build-a-open-source-smart-city-based-on-lora-7ca76b9a098). Don't forget to change the DIO0, DIO1, RST and DIO2 setting according to your wiring. If you are using our [ProMini PCB](https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw#pcbs) then the settings is respectively D2, D3, D4 and D5 when you solder together the corresponding solder pads. Normally you only need DIO0, DIO1 and RST. You can use the `Arduino_LoRa_LMIC_ABP_BASIC` example to send data either to a regular LoRaWAN gateway (which of course works) and more interestingly to our low-cost single channel LoRa gateway that has to be configured as follows:

- set `["radio_conf"]["mode"]` to 11 in `gateway_conf.json` to configure for LoRaWAN reception on single channel (868.1MHz)
- set `["gateway_conf"]["raw"]` to true in `gateway_conf.json` 
- set `["gateway_conf"]["aes_lorawan"]` to false to upload to a LoRaWAN cloud (for instance TheThingNetwork or ChirpStack)
- set `["gateway_conf"]["downlink_lorawan"]` to true to enable periodic PULL_DATA and get PULL_RESP (downlink messages) from Network Server
- indicate in `["gateway_conf"]["downlink_network_server"]` the address of the Network Server for downlink messages 
- enable LoRaWAN encrypted cloud in `clouds.json` as explained in [README-TTN](https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/blob/master/gw_full_latest/README-TTN.md)
		
Normally `Arduino_LoRa_LMIC_ABP_BASIC` use 868.1, 868.3 and 868.5. If you send to the low-cost gateway, you will loose 2 packets. You can disable 868.3 and 868.5 by uncommenting a small portion of code at the end of the `Arduino_LoRa_LMIC_ABP_BASIC` example:

```
    //added by C. Pham
    //uncomment to only have the first frequency when sending to our low-cost gateway
    //Disable all channels, except for the 0 
    //FOR TESTING ONLY!
    
    for (int i=1; i<9; i++) { // For EU; for US use i<71
      if(i != 0) {
        LMIC_disableChannel(i);
      }
    }
```

If you know what you are doing, you can enable local LoRaWAN AES decryption by:

- setting "aes_lorawan" to true
- but then, indicate both device's NwkSKey and AppSKey in `key_LoRaWAN.py`
- these keys can be found on your TTN account if you are using TTN LoRaWAN		
		
`Arduino_LoRa_temp` also shows a limited LoRaWAN support using our library (not LMIC, therefore DIO connection are not needed). You need to enable LoRaWAN features with the following define statements:

	#define LORAWAN
	#define WITH_RCVW

The default setting will be SF12BW125 using frequency 868.1MHz for BAND868, 923.2MHz for BAND900 and 433.175 for BAND433. Again, you need to create a device for instance on TTN to get the device short address (32 bits) and, if you want, both NwkSKey and AppSKey. These information have to be filled in the example code. You can use the same device definition for both `Arduino_LoRa_LMIC_ABP_BASIC` and `Arduino_LoRa_temp`. Both examples can send to a regular LoRaWAN gateway and to our low-cost gateway. 

`Arduino_LoRa_LMIC_OTAA_BASIC` is the basic LoRaWAN OTAA (Over The Air Activation) example from Thomas Telkamp and Matthijs Kooijman using the LMIC port for Arduino. After activation, it sends "Hello, world!" using DR_SF12 (i.e. SF12BW125). This example is for demonstrating the OTAA support with both an SX1301-based multi-channel concentrator hat (e.g. RAK831/2245, [README](https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/blob/master/gw_full_latest/scripts/rak2245-rak831/README.md)) and a single-channel configuration with our gateway framework. If you use a single-channel configuration, our slightly modified LMIC distribution already defines `LMIC_SCG` in order to force join-request uplink messages to only use the first LoRaWAN frequency (e.g. 868.1MHz for BAND868). If you have the multi-channel configuration, comment in `lmic/config.h`

```
	//////////////////
	//added by C. Pham, only for Single-Channel Gateway
	//#define LMIC_SCG
```

Refer to [README](https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/blob/master/gw_full_latest/README-downlink.md) for more information on LoRaWAN downlink (including OTAA) support with both multi-channel and single-channel configurations.

Using the RadioHead library for the end-device
----------------------------------------------

Although not recommended as you won't benefit from the advanced features proposed by our library, it is possible to use the RadioHead library to build an end-device that can send data to our gateway. The radio driver is `RH_RF95` which is primarily intended for the HopeRF RFM95/96/97/98 but other SX1276/77/78/79-based radio module will work. For instance both the Modtronix inAir9 and inAir9B. Care must be taken to correctly define the PA_BOOST support. Both RFM95W and inAir9B need PA_BOOST while the inAir9 uses the RFO instead. Also, the RadioHead library needs the radio's DIO 0 pin to be connected to an interrupt-enabled pin of the Arduino board. The RadioHead lib can be downloaded from [http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/).

Our library uses the following 4-byte header: `dst(1B)` `ptype(1B)` `src(1B)` `seq(1B)`. `ptype` is decomposed in 2 parts `type(4bits)` and `flags(4bits)`; `type` can take current value of `DATA=0001` and `ACK=0010`. The flags are from left to right: `ack_requested|encrypted|with_appkey|is_binary`. Fortunately the RH lib also use a 4-byte header: `to`, `from`, `id`, `flags`. It is therefore easy to have the following correspondance: `to <-> dst` and `from <-> src`; and use `id` for `ptype` and `flags` for `seq`. However, in RH_RF95, the field insertion order is: `to`, `from`, `id`, `flags` so to avoid changing the RH lib, we chose to use the following mapping:
 
```
   to <-> dst
 from <-> ptype
   id <-> src
flags <-> seq 
``` 

These variables will be set using the `RHDatagram.h` functions: `setHeaderTo`, `setHeaderfrom`, `setHeaderId`, `setHeaderFlags`. The **`Arduino_LoRa_Radiohead_Example`** provides an example sending "hello" using so-called LoRa mode 1 (BW125, CR45, SF12) on 865.2Mhz. PA_BOOST is activated by default and the DIO0 pin is connected to Arduino digital pin 2.
